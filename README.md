React boilerplate for Aragon applications.

This boilerplate also includes a fully working example app, complete with a background worker and a front-end in React (with Aragon UI).

## Usage

Kit support requires using the Aragon CLI with a version greater than 4.1.0.
```sh
npm install -g @aragon/cli
aragon init app react-kit
```

## Make the kit work with your app

- In order for the kit to work properly, it needs to know what the name of your app is. Replace `app` in [this line](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-react-kit-boilerplate/blob/dd7d571da4ab1ee6a0a82130b0c2c5d6218771b6/contracts/Kit.sol#L58) with the name of your app in the `arapp.json` file (e.g. `myapp` for `myapp.aragonpm.eth`)

- Edit the roles defined in the kit to configure your DAO as you want!

## Run the kit

```sh
aragon run --kit Kit --kit-init @ARAGON_ENS
```

## Running your app

### Using HTTP

Running your app using HTTP will allow for a faster development process of your app's front-end, as it can be hot-reloaded without the need to execute `aragon run` every time a change is made.

- First start your app's development server running `npm run start:app`, and keep that process running. By default it will rebuild the app and reload the server when changes to the source are made.

- After that, you can run `npm run start:aragon:http` or `npm run start:aragon:http:kit` which will compile your app's contracts, publish the app locally and create a DAO. You will need to stop it and run it again after making changes to your smart contracts.

Changes to the app's background script (`app/script.js`) cannot be hot-reloaded, after making changes to the script, you will need to either restart the development server (`npm run start:app`) or rebuild the script `npm run build:script`.

### Using IPFS

Running your app using IPFS will mimic the production environment that will be used for running your app. `npm run start:aragon:ipfs` will run your app using IPFS. Whenever a change is made to any file in your front-end, a new version of the app needs to be published, so the command needs to be restarted.

## What's in the box?
